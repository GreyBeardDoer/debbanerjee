Where has all the money gone?</em></p><p>It becomes even more painful if I have to pay more money to clear my tax dues. Every year this pain makes me decide that - <em>&quot;Before next year, I&apos;ll study and understand the income tax rules and apply them to plan and save as much tax as possible legally.&quot;</em></p><p>Yet, slowly the pain subsides and I completely forget about my decision until the next July comes.</p><p>This has been happening to me for the last 3-4 years. But in December 2022, I decided that I&apos;ll give this wish of mine a serious shot from January of 2023.</p><p>So, here it is....<strong>the lazy person&apos;s guide to the Indian income tax</strong>.</p><p>Before you start, however, here&apos;s the disclaimer -</p><p>I am no tax expert or CA. And I have no intention to generate any cash flow by providing tax planning or consultancy in the future. So, everything that I have written here or in the other articles linked here is on the basis of my own understanding. All of this is for knowledge only. Please take advice from a qualified and authorized tax professional before taking any decision related to your own tax and money.</p><p>Okay, now that it&apos;s out of the way, let&apos;s get started -</p><h2 id="why-the-hell-do-you-have-to-pay-income-tax">Why The Hell Do You Have To Pay Income Tax?</h2><p>You work your a** off every month from the 1st till the last day. You skip those family lunches so often to cram in a few extra hours for that incentive every year, right?</p><p>The taxmen don&apos;t come to help you when you struggle to meet your deadlines or run to board the train for your home.</p><p>Then why on earth do you have to pay them obediently every year? Is it really fair?</p><p>Well, whether it&apos;s fair or unfair could be a topic for debate for economists and tax experts. Let us set that debate aside and think practically.</p><p>What does the Government do with the taxpayer&apos;s money?</p><ul><li>Build new and better roads, railways, and ports.</li><li>Strengthen our defence infrastructure.</li><li>Launch welfare schemes like - free food grains during the COVID-19 pandemic, free vaccines for the elderly, etc.</li></ul><p>Yes, I agree that there are some crook businessmen who take huge loans from Government lenders and flee the country with the taxpayers&apos; money. But the good work must not stop just because some people want to exploit it for their vested interests.</p><p>You need to pay your taxes so that such good works may continue in India. No matter which Government comes to power. All of them will launch such schemes through which at least a part of our huge number of poor and needy people will get some benefits.</p><p>You can take a small part in that good work by paying your taxes regularly.</p><h2 id="okay-then-should-you-do-nothing-and-pay-all-that-taxmen-demand-from-you">Okay Then, Should You Do Nothing And Pay All That Taxmen Demand From You?</h2><p>Not at all. </p><p>You are not a monk! Neither am I.</p><p>We both know that there&apos;s actually no point fretting over the fairness of income tax. It is totally out of our control.</p><p>Instead, you can focus on what <em>is in your control</em>. </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How To Install A Local Ghost Blog On Ubuntu Desktop]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>I like a minimal online editor for writing online.
